## Metis_project3: predicting flight delay
### Description:
Being stranded at the airport is one of those horrible experiences (tiredness, frustration, and boredom) you would want to avoid. I once got stuck at the airport overnight, and I never booked with the same airline again. Moreover, if we are traveling on a tight business schedule, we would want to have more control over our schedule. This project is trying to build a model that predicts flight delay so travelers could better plan their trips.
